## Plan

This is the plan for working on software to support the problem sets on edX. The developmental work will be done against the problem set created for CSE103 and would involve making improvements to the problem set as well.

### General 

1. All of the code has to be factored into classes/methods that have an easy to understand public API.
2. All public parts of the code must have detailed in-code documentation using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/contents.html)
